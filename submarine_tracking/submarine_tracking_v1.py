# Step 1: Obtain the location data for the submarine
# For demonstration purposes, let's assume the location data is stored in a CSV file
submarine_data = pd.read_csv("submarine_location.csv")

# Step 2: Store the location data in a Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(submarine_data)

# Step 3: Analyze the location data to determine the movement pattern of the submarine
# Calculate the velocity and direction of the submarine
df['velocity'] = df['speed'].diff()
df['direction'] = df['heading'].diff()

# Calculate the depth of the submarine
df['depth'] = df['altitude'].diff()

# Step 4: Plot the submarine's location over time
plt.plot(df['timestamp'], df['latitude'], label='Latitude')
plt.plot(df['timestamp'], df['longitude'], label='Longitude')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Step 5: Continuously update the location data and repeat the analysis steps
# Code to continuously update the location data and repeat the analysis steps
