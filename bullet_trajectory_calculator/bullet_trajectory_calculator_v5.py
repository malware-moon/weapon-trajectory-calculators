# In this script, the Coriolis acceleration is calculated by multiplying the spin rate by the y component of the velocity vector. The drag force and velocity vector are also updated to account for the effect of wind velocity. Note that the Coriolis acceleration is calculated in the x-y plane, so the component of the Coriolis acceleration in the x-direction is given by coriolis_acceleration * np.sin(angle_rad) and the component in the y-direction is given by coriolis_acceleration * np.cos(angle_rad). The effect of both the Coriolis force and wind on the velocity vector is included in the update of both velocity_x and velocity_y.

# Please keep in mind that this script is a simplified model of bullet trajectory and may not be entirely accurate for all conditions. It's meant to be a starting point for further experimentation and development.
